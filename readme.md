# Chuck - Rpi - Gpio

Code contains some ChuCK shreds to listen on an OSC channel.

Associated Python scripts listen on GPIO pins and send a
signal over OSC channel when a press is detected.

GPIO pins should be hooked up to some buttons in a circuit.

The end result is ChuCK shreds responding to events in the
real world.
